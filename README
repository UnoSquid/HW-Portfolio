Get your portfolio base set up!

- Fork this repo. <check>

- Break out the different style sections from style.css into individual CSS files. You should end up with base.css, common.css, 320.css, 480.css, 768.css, and 1140.css. <check - not sure if I got the right stuff in the right places>

- Include these stylesheets with the appropriate media queries in the index.html file. <check>
** Â¡MUCHO IMPORTANTE! ** - make sure you include the CSS files *BEFORE* the modernizr script is included.

- Replace the orange theme/colors with your own style (can just be black/white for now if you're feeling uninspired). <check>

- Add personal-type links to the header nav. Some combination of twitter, Tumblr, Facebook (*shudder*), contact, about, etc. These links don't have to go anywhere yet. <check>

- Convert the aside to a nav element. Make an unordered list with a few placeholder list items. Style the list so the items are stacked on top of each other. <check>

- Inside the new nav element, create a new aside element. This element should hold a small picture of you, your name, and a short (3-ish line) bio. <check>

- When the screen is less than 768px, hide the aside in the new nav element.

- Add your small profile picture (the same one from the new aside element above) to the footer, along with your name. <check>

- Repeat header links in the footer. <check, though not cooperating>

- You can make things look all pretty later on. For now, just worry about getting the layout working. (I mean, make it look nice if you've got the time, but it's not required yet.)
